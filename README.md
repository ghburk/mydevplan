# my software development learning plan
To remember:
1. This is hard
2. Requires commitment, dedication, and lifetime of learning
3. After over 25 years of it, I still pull my hear out in frustration trying to get shit to work
4. Rewarding
5. Don’t be intimidated, though. Dedication, intentionality, and consistency over time FTW. Always be learning!

Need to balance
1. Theory / Academic
2. Practical

These are some of the things you will need to learn (there are more, many more!).
1. General Purpose Programming Language 
    1. Prefer a language that supports learning core comp sci material while still being practical for OTJ
        1. Algorithms & Data Structures
        2. Comp Sci specialties have their specific stuff
        3. Object Oriented programming
        4. Functional Programming
        5. Aspect Orient Programming
        6. Etc
    2. Learning the ecosystem of a language is often the biggest challenge
        1. Frameworks, libraries
    3. Some languages are very big (C#, Java) which present challenges. What do your discard for the sake of learning fundamentals well?
    4. Debugging
    5. Security
    6. Testing
    7. Builds & Deployment
1. Command Line & Shell scripting
3. Source Code Version Control
4. Operating Systems
5. Databases
6. Cloud
7. Markup & Presentation (HTML, CSS)
8. Software Development Lifecycle
9. DevOps

**Our plan of attack (for now)** <br>
Language: **JavaScript** (leans much more on the practical side) <br>
Language EcoSystem: **Node + NPM** <br>
Command Line & Shell Scripting: **Bash** <br>
Source Code Version Control: **Git + GitHub** <br>
Operating Systems: **Linux (via MacOS)** <br>
Database: **Relational (Postgres?)** (will require learning SQL, which is its own domain specific language) <br>
Cloud: **AWS (to start)** <br>
Markup & Presentation: **HTML, CSS, Markup (Markup for github readme.md files)** <br>
SDLC: **TBD** <br>
DevOps: **TBD** <br>
Code Editor:  **Visual Studio Code + nano (for command line)**

**Your Tasks for the week of 12/30/19**
1. Continue working through the FrontEnd Dev Course I sent you
2. Install Visual Studio Code
3. Create a GitHub account
    1. Send me your user id
    2. Create a public repository named mydevplan
    3. Clone repository on your machine and add a README.md file that says “my software development learning plan”
    4. Put everything in this email into your README.md file (will require you go through a short tutorial of Markup language—easy peasy) and check it into your repository.
    5. Work with me on the above steps—we are going to get your started using the command line for this stuff right away.
4. Create an AWS account
    1. Do the first “hands on” part of The Good Parts of AWS – creating a simple web app and manually deploying to an AWS EC2 instance
